Classes with `IDisposable` members are responsible for cleaning up those members by calling their `Dispose` methods. The best
practice here is for the owning class to itself implement `IDisposable` and call its members' `Dispose` methods from its own
`Dispose` method.

## Noncompliant Code Example

<pre>
public class ResourceHolder   // Noncompliant; doesn't implement IDisposable
{
  private FileStream fs;  // This member is never Dispose'd
  public void OpenResource(string path)
  {
    this.fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
  }
  public void CloseResource()
  {
    this.fs.Close();
  }
}
</pre>

## Compliant Solution

<pre>
public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable
{
  private FileStream fs;
  public void OpenResource(string path)
  {
    this.fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
  }
  public void CloseResource()
  {
    this.fs.Close();
  }

  public void Dispose()
  {
    this.fs.Dispose();
  }
}
</pre>
