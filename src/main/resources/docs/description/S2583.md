If a boolean expression cannot evaluate to anything but `true`, this expression is completely redundant. From time to time, such useless
expression can be used on purpose to increase the readability of the code. But such expression deserves to be carefully reviewed to make sure that was
the initial programmer's intent.

## Noncompliant Code Example

<pre>
if (a &amp;&amp; b)
{
  if(a)   //a is always true
  {
  }
}
</pre>
