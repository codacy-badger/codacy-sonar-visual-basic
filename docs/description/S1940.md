It is needlessly complex to invert the result of a boolean comparison. The opposite comparison should be made instead.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    If Not (a = 2) Then  // Noncompliant
    Dim b as Boolean = Not (i < 10)  // Noncompliant


## Compliant Solution


    If a <> 2 Then
    Dim b as Boolean = i >= 10
