When a cookie is configured with the `HttpOnly` attribute set to *true*, the browser guaranties that a client-side script will be<br>unable to read it. In most of the cases, when a cookie is created,the default value of `HttpOnly` is *false* and it's up to the<br>developer to decide whether or not the content of the cookie can be read by the client-side script. Majority of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks<br>target the theft of session-cookies, the `HttpOnly` attribute could help to reduce their impact as it won't be possible to exploit the XSS<br>vulnerability to steal session-cookies.

## Ask Yourself Whether

- the cookie is a *session-cookie* and the `HttpOnly` flag is not set to *true*
- the content of the cookie is sensitive and the `HttpOnly` flag is not set to *true*
- the `HttpOnly` attribute offer an additional protection (not the case for an *XSRF-TOKEN cookie* / CSRF token for example)<br>  but it is not set to *true*


You are at risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

- You should by default set the `HttpOnly` flag to *true* for most of your cookies and it's mandatory for session /<br>  sensitive-security cookies.


## Sensitive Code Examples

For example In C# you can specify the HttpOnly flag for[HttpCookie](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httpcookie?view=netframework-4.8) object.


    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    myCookie.HttpOnly = false;  // Sensitive:  this sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag set to false and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability


The [default value](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httpcookie.httponly?view=netframework-4.8) of<br>`secure` flag is false:


    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    // Sensitive: this sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag not defined (by default set to false)  and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability


## Compliant Solution


    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    myCookie.HttpOnly = true; // Compliant: the sensitive cookie is protected against theft thanks to the HttpOnly property set to true (HttpOnly = true)
